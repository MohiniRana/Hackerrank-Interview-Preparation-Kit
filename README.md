# Basic-Python-Codes
Hello there!

I have created this folder especially for Beginners who want to learn to start coding in Python with basics.
To practice the codes, I highly recommend to use Jupyter Notebooks as it is very user-friendly and simple to use for coding.
However, you are free to choose the platformyou are most comfortable with.

Best,
Your friendly coder,
Mohini Rana
